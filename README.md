# Temperature Control System
The goal of this project is to design a temperature monitoring system that controls and regulates the temperature of a particular environment.\\ We need two ATMega32 microcontrollers, one to read the value of temperature and another to take action upon it. Therefore, the two chips must be connected using a communication protocol (SPI is advised in this case). The tasks of each chip are mentioned below:
